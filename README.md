## Description 
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. The goal of this project is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.

This application utilizes Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
